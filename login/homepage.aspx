                     <h3>The State Pharmaceuticals Corporation was
                 established in 1971 under the State Industrial 
                Corporations Act Number 49 of 1957. This far-sighted
                 decision was the result of the report submitted by 
                Prof. Senaka Bible and Dr.S.A. Wickramasinghe 
                report (March 1971) based on an assignment given to
                 them by the then Prime Minister, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike.

                  Prof. Senaka Bible Going by the vision of its
                 founding father Professor Senaka Bibile, 
                the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) has at 
                all times striven to provide quality assured drugs 
                at prices that are reasonable in the market. For the 
                past 40 years SPC has been the sole supplier of pharmaceuticals,
                 surgical consumable Items, laboratory
                 chemicals and equipment to all institutions administered
                 by the health ministry.</h3>
